        <h1>Project Name - Long version</h1>
        <p>Template github repository that can be used e.g. for the publication of the code when submitting a paper. </p>
<p>GH Actions are set to:</p>
<ol>
<li>convert the ipynb to html, create an index html page and store all the pages in a separate branch, where they can be published as static website with github pages</li>
<li>create a README index file for the repo that contains all the links to the html and ipynb files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to fork it for "publishing" your own notebooks, and <a href="mailto:matteo.bonfanti@fht.org">contact me</a> with suggestions for improvements.</p>
    <p>

<h2><a href=01_RawImport.html>raw data import</a></h2><p>This is a <strong>test notebook</strong>. A very basic example of notebook, just to exemplify how the
GitHub Actions defined in this repository work.</p>
<p>If you want to add your own notebooks, just put the ipynb files in the root project folder and then
customize the "pages" section of the <a href="https://github.com/matbonfanti/project-template/blob/main/resources/config.yaml">config.yaml</a>
file by including the notebooks that need to be indexed. The "notebook" attribute defines the name
of the ipynb file and the "description" attribute contains a descriptive string that will be
included in the README and html index.</p>

      <p>Here you can put some final remarks.
These will be appended at the end of the README / index page.</p>
